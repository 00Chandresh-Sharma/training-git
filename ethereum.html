Ethereum was initially described in late 2013 in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin,[5][11] a programmer and co-founder of Bitcoin Magazine, that described a way to build decentralized applications.[12][13] Buterin argued to the Bitcoin Core developers that Bitcoin and blockchain technology could benefit from other applications besides money and that it needed a more robust language for application development[14]: 88  that could lead to attaching[clarification needed] real-world assets, such as stocks and property, to the blockchain.[15] In 2013, Buterin briefly worked with eToro CEO Yoni Assia on the Colored Coins project and drafted its white paper outlining additional use cases for blockchain technology.[16] However, after failing to gain agreement on how the project should proceed, he proposed the development of a new platform with a more robust scripting language—a Turing-complete programming language[17]—that would eventually become Ethereum.
